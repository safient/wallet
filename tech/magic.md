## ETHDenver bounty details for Magic:
    
We integrated Magic email and social logins to authenticate and craete a signer in our application. The integration of email, GitHub and Google based authentication allowed users to seamlessly create account and interact with our application.

Behind the scence we use the Signer generated using Magic to create a new DID on our application.

This [PR](https://github.com/safient/wallet/pull/25) integrated Magic to Safient Wallet.
